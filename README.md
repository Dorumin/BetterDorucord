You need to run this one each time after Discord updates. I might bind a separate process so that it catches when it is updated, but for now you may just want to add it to some autorun folder.

Preferably a shortcut. No idea how it's done in OSes other than Windows, but there's always win+R > "shell:startup" if you are on the greatest OS ever made.
